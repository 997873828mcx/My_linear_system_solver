# linear_system_solver
I include how to run test at another doc on github.

What I did is a linear system solver solving(Ax = b) for a matrix A using Gaussian elimination with pivoting and back substitution.

I wrote a class MyLinearSystemSolver.
Some basic functions were modified from some templates on course documentation.

Member function GaussianElimination() transfer the matrix to row echelon form.

BackSub() then use back substitution to solve the root. The correct root generated by this program may not be exactly the 
correct answer, for example, for a root 3, this program will get 2.99999999999, but it will display 3.

verify() then verify the root is the solution of A x_sol - b = 0

MatrixMultiplication() is something not used, but can be used to calculate multiplication of matrix.
